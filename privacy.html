Your information is used only for the following purposes:
To provide the core service of the App.
To securely send your one-time chat notification to your own LIVE stream at your request.
To save your settings (like themes and custom text) for your next stream.
3. How We Store and Protect Your Information
Your TikTok User ID and Access Token are stored securely in an encrypted database. We use industry-standard security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
4. Information Sharing
We DO NOT and will NEVER share, sell, rent, or trade your information with any third parties for marketing or any other purpose.
The only time your information is used is for the direct, server-to-server communication with the TikTok API to post your message.
5. Data Deletion
You can revoke the App's permissions at any time via your TikTok account settings. If you wish for your data (User ID and Access Token) to be permanently deleted from our database, please contact us at [Your Support Email Address], and we will process your request.
